# Dronecode Camera Manager Documentation - Source Code

The *Dronecode Camera Manager* (DCM) is an extensible Linux camera server for interfacing any camera with the [Dronecode Platform](https://www.dronecode.org/) via MAVLink and RTSP. Documentation for the CM is available here: [TEMP](https://hamishwillee.gitbooks.io/camera-streaming-daemon/content/en/)

This repository contains the *source code for the documentation*.

The documentation is hosted on [gitbook.com](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/hamishwillee/camera-streaming-daemon/details). It is generated from source code (in markdown format) using the [gitbook toolchain](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/). 

The CM source code itself can be found on github here: [Dronecode/camera-manager](https://github.com/Dronecode/camera-manager).
