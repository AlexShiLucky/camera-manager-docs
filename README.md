The *Camera Streaming Daemon* (CSD) is an extensible Linux camera server for interfacing any camera with the [Dronecode Platform](https://www.dronecode.org/) via MAVLink and RTSP. Documentation for the CSD is available here: [TEMP](https://hamishwillee.gitbooks.io/camera-streaming-daemon/content/en/)

This repository contains the *source code for the documentation*.

The documentation is hosted on [gitbook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/book/hamishwillee/dronecode-camera-server-sdk/details). It is generated from source code (in markdown format) using the [gitbook toolchain](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/).
